                  GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for
                  fulfilling those queries with your existing data. GraphQL
                  provides a complete and understandable description of the data
                  in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what
                  they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs
                  over time, and enables powerful developer tools.
